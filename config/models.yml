    type: chat_completion
    name: GQL
    description: Groq's LLAMA-70B instantiation. Groq is on a mission to set the standard for GenAI inference speed, helping real-time AI applications come to life today. The LPU is designed to overcome the two LLM bottlenecks- compute density and memory bandwidth. An LPU has greater compute capacity than a GPU and CPU in regards to LLMs. This reduces the amount of time per word calculated, allowing sequences of text to be generated much faster.

  mixtral8x7b:
    type: chat_completion
    name: Mix
    description: Mixtral 8x7B, a high-quality sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights. Licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks with 6x faster inference. It is the strongest open-weight model with a permissive license and the best model overall regarding cost/performance trade-offs. In particular, it matches or outperforms GPT3.5 on most standard benchmarks.
